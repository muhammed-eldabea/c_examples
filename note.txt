when  calling a function we have a function argument 
when we declear it we have a function parameters 
function parameters cant be recleared inside the function body >>error 
    Ram memory segement : 
        1-stack  : 
            local variable and return address 
        2-Heap : 
            Dynamic data storage 
        3- .Data : 
            static and non Zero global data 
        4- .bss 
            zero global variable non initializer global and static  
any function called in programe has it own (activation record ) stack frame 

Storage class : 
    define the duration of variable in memory 
    the segement at which variable will stored 
    linkage data between files 

    1- auto storage class : 
        all local variable by defualt are auto  
        life time start and end with function life 
        stored in stack with garbage value in case of uninizialized 
    2- register storage class : 
        tell compiler to store data in cpu register with more speed 
         it life time as programe run 
         cant use the unary operator with register >> compilaation error as  we dont know in which register data stored 
    3- static : 
        put data in data segement 
        life time is as programe run 
        initialized to zero automaticaly 
        static with global >> restrict access of varible within file at which it declear 
        static with function >> restrict access of function within file  
    4-extern 
        give access to a global variable in a file to make it seen in another one 
Guard file >> prevent double inclusion
